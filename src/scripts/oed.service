# This should be copied to /etc/systemd/system/ and the copy renamed so that its function will be clear to admins.
# 1) Modify the WorkingDirectory variable to set it to the root directory of OED
# 2) Modify the user variable to set it to the user that has permission to run OED. While this could be root, it is best
# to use a non-privileged user for security reasons. This can normally be the user that cloned the OED git repository
# and owns the OED files.
