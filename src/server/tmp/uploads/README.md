# Temporary Files

## /tmp/uploads
The files in this directory come from uploads. The name of the subdirectory that the file 
is in denotes where the file came from. For example, if a csv file is in `/tmp/uploads/csvPipeline`, then 
it came via the csv pipeline. These files are typically deleted automatically in the same process from which 
they arrived.
