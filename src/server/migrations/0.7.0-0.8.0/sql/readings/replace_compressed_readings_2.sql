CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION compressed_readings_2(meter_ids INTEGER[], start_stamp TIMESTAMP, end_stamp TIMESTAMP, min_day_points INTEGER, min_hour_points INTEGER)
	RETURNS TABLE(meter_id INTEGER, reading_rate FLOAT, start_timestamp TIMESTAMP, end_timestamp TIMESTAMP)

		The minimum day and hourly points are determined so that data is read from the daily view when the
		requested interval is at least two months, from the hourly view when between two months and at least two weeks,
		and directly from the raw readings table when under two weeks.

		+----------------------+--------------------
		| Space considerations |
		+----------------------+
		Each row returned by this function contains 1 INT (meter_id), 2 TIMESTAMPs (start/end stimestamp), and
		1 FLOAT (reading_rate). According to PostgreSQL documentation, the storage size of INT is 4 bytes,
		TIMESTAMP is 8 bytes, and FLOAT is 8 bytes, and so each row totals to 28 bytes of data.

		For example, if the requested range is one year, this algorithm will read from the materialized daily view
		and return 0.01 megabytes of data.
		
		From the hourly view, the number rows that can be read ranges from 360 (the minimum) to 60 * 24 = 1440
		points. Hence, the amount of data read from the hourly view ranges from 0.010 to 0.040 megabytes
		per meter. 
		
		From the readings table, the number of rows returned depends on the raw reading granularity.
		The most common reading granularity for electric meters is 15-minutes, which means the meter
		stores data for every 15-minute interval.

		The transition from hourly to raw readings occurs when the number of hourly points is 359 or less which is
		less than 15 days or roughly two weeks.

		If the granularity is 15-minutes, then the maximum amount of raw points is 359 * 4 = 1436, which translates
		to 0.040 megabytes per meter.
		If instead the raw readings granularity is 1-minute, then the maximum amount of raw points is 359 * 60 = 21540,
		which translates to 0.60 megabytes per meter. 
		

		+------+-------------------
		| TODO |
		+------+
		- Note that the above documentation does not account for the increase in data when packaged in JSON format.
		- This function is complicated by the fact that groups can contain meters with different levels of granularity.
		We address this now by having sites pick a site-level reading frequency. (Not done)
		- When resource generalization is implemented in OED, this function will need to be done in a 
		meter-by-meter basis, since different resource meters will have different levels of granularity.
